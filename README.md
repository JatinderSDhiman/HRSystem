# HR Management System

HR Management System API

This repository contains the code for the HR Management System API built using Node.js and Express. The API provides endpoints for managing HR-related tasks such as employee data, attendance tracking, and payroll processing.

Getting Started

To get started with the HR Management System API, you'll need to have Node.js installed on your local machine. Then, you can clone this repository and install the required dependencies by running the following commands in your terminal:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/hr-management-system-api.git
cd hr-management-system-api
npm install

Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the server by running:

npm start

The server will be running at http://localhost:4000.

Contributing

Contributions to the HR Management System API are welcome! If you'd like to contribute, please fork this repository and submit a pull request.

Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)

This project uses Jenkins for continuous integration and continuous deployment. A Jenkinsfile is included in the repository that defines the pipeline stages. The pipeline is triggered automatically on every push to the main branch.

Pipeline Stages
The following stages are defined in the Jenkinsfile:

Build: This stage runs the npm install command to install the project dependencies, and then builds the project using the npm run build command.
Unit Test: This stage runs the unit tests for the project using the npm run test command.
Lint: This stage runs the linter for the project using the npm run lint command.
Publish to Artifacts: This stage packages the built project files as artifacts and publishes them to a remote artifact repository for later deployment. This is done using the npm pack command to create a .tgz file, and then the curl command to upload the file to the artifact repository. Note that this stage is only executed if the previous stages (build, unit test, and lint) are successful.
Deploy to Development Environment(mocked): This stage deploys the packaged artifacts to a development environment using a remote deployment script. This is done using the ssh command to connect to the development server, and then running a deployment script on the server. Note that this stage is only executed if the previous stages (build, unit test, lint, and publish to artifacts) are successful.
Deploy to QA Environment (mocked): This stage deploys the packaged artifacts to a QA environment using a remote deployment script. This is done using the ssh command to connect to the QA server, and then running a deployment script on the server. Note that this stage is only executed if the previous stages (build, unit test, lint, and publish to artifacts) are successful.
Deploy to Staging Environment (mocked): This stage deploys the packaged artifacts to a staging environment using a remote deployment script. This is done using the ssh command to connect to the staging server, and then running a deployment script on the server. Note that this stage is only executed if the previous stages (build, unit test, lint, and publish to artifacts) are successful.
Deploy to Production Environment (mocked): This stage deploys the packaged artifacts to the production environment using a remote deployment script. This is done using the ssh command to connect to the production server, and then running a deployment script on the server. Note that this stage is only executed if the previous stages (build, unit test, lint, and publish to artifacts) are successful.
Artifact Repository
The artifact repository used by this project is hosted on a remote server and is used to store the packaged artifacts generated by the "Publish to Artifacts" stage. These artifacts are then downloaded and deployed to the various environments during the deployment stages.
